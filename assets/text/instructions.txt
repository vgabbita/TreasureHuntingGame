You're an explorer who has stumbled upon the
pyramid of a famous Pharaoh that's said to
hold vast treasures. You'll explore the
pyramid, entering various rooms and
completing different tasks. Along the way,
you'll have to encounter snakes and other
monsters, transcribe a secret scroll, and
find the Pharaoh's final resting place.
Beware: you'll only have 3 minutes to find the
treasure. Good luck, explorer. You'll need it.
